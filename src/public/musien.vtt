[Music]

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.939
Just feeling

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.400
A bit lonelier than usual

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.140
Words trickle out, there's nothing for me

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.780
To hold onto

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.340
Just let me

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.780
Shed a tear or two

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.640
Like that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.760
In these days we spend, someday, somehow they'll mean something

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.640
Like this

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.199
In these nights of hurt, a single sound of light

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.820
Will come soon, even before tomorrow

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.560
I'll no longer be afraid to say

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.220
Just thank you for your kindness

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.490
And today, today, I'll be able to smile

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:33.190
[Music]

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.439
Like this

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.060
In these painful days, someday, somehow

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.780
I'll be embraced

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.220
Like this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.020
Lead me through

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.340
The night

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.240
And

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.180
[Music]

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.560
I'll become an adult, understanding

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.419
Even if it's just the warm heart that comes on this journey

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.800
I haven't forgotten

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.900
The faint lingering

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500
Sound of warmth

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.480
Now, in front of the coming tomorrow

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.400
I'll envision

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.700
The dreams of this world

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.879
And today, when it stops gently

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.940
I'll be able to smile today

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.980
Even if I'm a bit scared and I hide it in my heart sometimes

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.580
Even those difficult emotions

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.400
I'll embrace them

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.099
If they were to remain blue forever

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.739
It's still okay

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.840
If I can say I'm not afraid today

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:16.499
